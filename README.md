# Gallery
A gallery for personal art pieces, using NodeJS and Express as a backend for website routing, with custom HTML, CSS, and Javascript for front-end functionality and style.

Requires NodeJS to run; to see the website in action, feel free to download the repository and run a "node start.js" command, having NodeJS installed.
